### About Destination Mars

Destination Mars is a digital 3D experience, that lets the user fly through outer space.\
It was inspired by [a game made by Paul Henschel](https://codesandbox.io/embed/r3f-game-i2160)

This app was made with following technology:
- JavaScript
- React.js + Hooks
- [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)
- [drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) - a library of abstractions and helpers for react-three-fiber
- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - state management solution based on hooks
